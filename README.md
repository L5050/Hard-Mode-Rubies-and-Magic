# Rubies and Magic Update: Phase 1
A custom Count Bleck boss fight, replacing the fight in 8-4. Uses SPM Hard Mode as a base and will be added to Hard Mode permanently eventually.
You can use [Flipside Mod Manager](https://github.com/L5050/Flipside-Mod-Manager) to install it, and the save file for the custom boss fight can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/L5050/Hard-Mode-Rubies-and-Magic/releases/tag/SaveFile)
