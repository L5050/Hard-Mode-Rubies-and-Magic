# Rubies and Magic Update: Phase 1
A custom Count Bleck boss fight, replacing the fight in 8-4. Uses SPM Hard Mode as a base and will be added to Hard Mode permanently eventually.
After May 5th you can use [Flipside Mod Manager](https://github.com/L5050/Flipside-Mod-Manager) to install it, as it will be available in the manager's mod library after that point
